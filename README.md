# Santiago Rodr√≠guez Portfolio

This is my own protfolio to showcase my skills as a developer, you can use it as
a template if you'll like, but please don't make your portfolio same as mine.

## Setup

Just clone this repository, for now is pure HTML & CSS, so you won't need to install anything special.

## License
