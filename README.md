# portfolio

This is a Ruby on Rails (6) application for managing a developer portfolio,
you are the owner, you manage your contact information and your projects. You
must login to change things, and when you are done you just logout, everything
is just joy and hapinness.

Actually, I just wanted to practice with Ruby on Rails.
